  /// currently kafka and other brokers do many re-compression
  ///   1) form the transport RPC mechanism
  ///   2) from the disk format and ultimate disk layout
  /// There is also at least one memcpy of all bytes into the caches:
  ///   1) To the disk cache - we keep a 1MB write-behind cache if the direct io
  ///      is catching behind
  ///   2) To the internal - page cache - since we don't use the operating system
  ///      which must keep 1MB per open file.
  ///
  /// We have locks, and many other mem copies the java.nio.channels.FileChannel
  /// uses for example https://goo.gl/hrTnjY
  /// since we don't then again copy into the page cache.
  ///
  /// Last, we don't keep any logs. Currently the kafka path is synchronized 3 times.
